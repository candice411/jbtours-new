<p><strong>Why travel by JB Train Tours holiday train tour?</strong></p>
      <p>It is <strong>Comfortable, Affordable, Safe  &amp; Secure</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>PLUS</strong></p>
      <p>You don’t get lost – we do the planning  and driving<br />
        You won’t be affected by petrol price  increases – our tour price remains as advertised<br />
        Tour guides travel with you       <br />
        You relive the  nostalgia of travelling by train<br />
        You return from  holiday with no post-holiday stress or tiredness<br />
        We do the  planning, booking and organising – you just travel along<br />
        Because travelling  by train is ‘lekker’!</p>
<p>When last did you listen to the  ‘click-clack’ sound of the train’s wheels on  the iron track? When last did you  taste the sumptuous ‘Railway’ meals ?<br />
  When was the last time you slept on a  train…or experienced the peace of the Karoo  while watching the sunset and the kilometers rolling by?</p>
<p><strong>JB Train Tours </strong>relives these experiences on  different train tours to various destinations  in Southern Africa. Some of these trips are<strong> exclusive</strong> to our passengers on  tour, whilst the <strong>safety and security</strong> of our passengers are always major  issues to us.</p>
      <p>We host <strong>&lsquo;budget&rsquo;</strong> and <strong>&lsquo;upmarket&rsquo;</strong> train tours.</p>
      <p>Please visit <a href="/upmarket">upmarket</a> for  more information on the <strong>upmarket</strong> tours, or contact our offices.</p>
      <p>The pace of our train tours is slow and convenient, thus <strong>all ages</strong> would be able to enjoy it. We don’t rush from Point A to  Point B, but we still visit all the places worthwhile seeing. You will discover  interesting places you’ve never heard of before!</p>
      <p>Lately train holidays have become one of  the most <strong>affordable</strong> and <strong>comfortable</strong> ways of travelling. We  organise it and you sit back, relax and enjoy. <strong>No</strong> <strong>more</strong> holiday  planning, looking for the best accommodation, driving long distances, getting  lost, petrol &amp; toll gate increases, eating poor food, worrying about safety  and all these nibbling issues. We’ll <strong>add value to your life</strong> in a  pleasant, relaxing and safe way. </p>
      <p>Southern Africa still has so much to offer and  we want to show it to you. See our country from a different point of view. We  go where cars normally don’t and can’t go.</p>
      <p><strong>JB Train Tours</strong> used to  offer <strong>chartered</strong> train tours, for  quite a number of years, from Gauteng (Pretoria and Johannesburg) to  various destinations across Southern Africa. </p>
      <p style="font-size:11px;">On June 1st,  2006, Spoornet announced that no more Charter trains would run from 1 January  2007. Hence, we had to look for and find alternative means of taking our  passengers to their holiday destinations. We have succeeded in doing so by  organising some new tours and maintained some of our long-standing tours. The  main difference now are that once we have arrived at our destination, we sleep <strong>off</strong> the train &amp; we travel on  scheduled Shosholoza Meyl trains.</p>
      <p>Our Company now utilises <strong>Shosholoza Meyl’s</strong> (the company  &amp; train service provider) <strong>Tourist Class</strong> trains. I.e.: The Trans  Karoo, Trans Orange &amp; Algoa, as well as the <strong>upmarket</strong> Premier Classe  &amp; historical Shongololo Express trains. Note: The Trans Natal Tourist Class  train has been permanently withdrawn from service between Jo’burg and Durban on 1st  August 2010.</p>
We invite you to travel with us and would like  to welcome you on board. You would  most likely feel like a stranger when you board the train but when you get off  you will be part of the “bigger train family”.
