      <div style="border:1px solid #000; padding: 5px;"><strong>About the Premier  Classe train</strong>
      <p>The Premier Classe train is filling a gap in the  travel industry in South Africa and it will encourage people to travel again by  train over long distances. </p>
      <p>Shosholoza Meyl launched its luxurious Premier  Classe train in 2001 and upgraded it in 2006 and 2007. Since then it has  grown steadily in status and JB Train Tours is making use of it regularly. It  is a casual trip, but stylish. The number of spaces on this luxury train is  limited. Hence, we suggest you book well in advance. </p>
      <p>When travelling on the Premier Classe train you are treated and pampered. All the fine  cuisine meals are included in  the tour price, as well as high tea, welcome drinks &amp; snacks and bedding.  All drinks and expenses of a personal nature are for your own account. This is  travelling by train like in the &lsquo;olden days&rsquo;! </p>
