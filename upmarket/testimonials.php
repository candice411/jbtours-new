                  Geagte Jolene,<br />
                  <br />
                  Ons het op 12-15 Desember met julle upmarket pakket met die Blou Trein na Kaapstad gereis en teruggekeer met die vliegtuig. Ek wil julle graag komplimenteer met die uitstaande reelings en diens. Vandat ons by die Manhatten Hotel aangemeld het totdat ons weer daar terugbesorg is was die re&euml;lings puik. Die ervaring van die rit met die Blou Trein was baie spesiaal en iets besonders wat ek aan enige persoon kan aanbeveel.<br />
                  Baie dankie vir julle puik re&euml;lings.<br />
                  <br />
                  Groete<br />

                  Hi Nelani,<br />
                  <br />
                  This mail serves to thank you and JB Tours for the wonderful trip we had with my mon.<br />
                  It was a great experience, the one it'll take forever to forget. We really had a wonderful time<br />
                  and made new friends along the way.<br />
                  The service was great wherever we traveled we were met with warm hands until our last drop off point,<br />
                  even then our driver was just so wonderful.<br />
                  <br />
                  Thanks again for making my dream come true, my mother was so happy and impressed. All I wanted<br />
                  was to make her feel special and it did happen.<br />
                  <br />
                  Since my trip I had given you so many referrals and you can rest assured that I will be back again to book another trip.<br />
                  <br />
                  All the best to you and the JB tours family.<br />

                  Nogmaals baie dankie vir al die re&euml;lings met ons reis na Kaapstad en terug,daar was geen haakplekke nie en die rit op die Blou Trein was 'n belewenis wat ons lank sal onthou.<br />
                  Ek het 40 jaar vir die Spoorwe&euml; gewerk en gedink dat 'n rit met hierdie trein 'n moet is.<br />

<p>Hallo Jolene,                </p>
                <p>Net om dankie te se vir 'n baie goed gereelde en aangename toer. Die trein het gaan staan tussen Katlehong en Tokoza sonder krag vir omtrent 'n uur en toe weer tussen Klerksdorp en Orkney vir omtrent 3 ure. Dit het vreeslik gereen. Vir ons was dit 'n bonus om die mooi veld te sien die damme water langs die spoor. Ons het gevolglik meer van die Karoo die volgende dag te sien gekry. Die Karoo was mooi en groen en al die boere moet dankbaar wees vir die reen.                </p>
                <p>Alles het vlot in die hotel verloop en het 'n mooi hoek kamer gekry met 'n pratige uitsig op Tafelberg.                </p>
                <p>Ons is van plan om volgende jaar weer een van julle toere te neem miskien die&nbsp;Namibie of&nbsp;Namaqua Land toere.                </p>
                <p>Groete,</p>

              <p>Dear Jolene              </p>
              <p>Despite a couple of   disappointments Carol and I really enjoyed our trip to Namaqualand.&nbsp; What were   the disappointments?              </p>
              <p>Firstly, the cancellation of   the train trip to Cape Town.&nbsp; This was beyond your control and you are to be   congratulated for what you did to overcome this setback.&nbsp; How you managed to   find 44 seats on an aeroplane at such short notice is a miracle!&nbsp; This turned   out to be a blessing in disguise - we were able to spend more time with our son   and daughter-in-law&nbsp;and our three month old granddaughter on Sunday afternoon   and we used the day free in Cape Town to visit Robben Island.&nbsp; It was exciting   and different&nbsp;for us, as old Capetonians, to spend a day in Cape Town as   tourists and we enjoyed it thoroughly.              </p>
              <p>Secondly, the lack of flowers   in the quantity that one sees in all the advertising photographs.&nbsp; This again   was beyond your control and there was more than just the flowers to see and   enjoy.              </p>
              <p>If we have a gripe it is that   the trip was very tiring - 11 hours in and on and off the bus on both the first   and second days was too much.&nbsp; The second night should have been spent somewhere   in or near Springbok - trekking all the way there only to have to come all the   way back to Vredendal is not a good idea.              </p>
              <p>Now for the good news - there   were two gems on the bus.&nbsp; Our driver Lloyd Samuels was a star and not once did   we feel that we were in any danger.&nbsp; But the real star was Kobus Barnard.&nbsp; He   had a terrible job - a bus full of people who wanted to see acres of   multi-coloured flowers and mostly all they saw was green and brown bush and   grass.&nbsp; But he managed to find as many flowers as one possibly could have in the   circumstances, he was always cheerful and optimistic, he never failed to   entertain and to inform us and he worked hard at making our trip the best that   it could possibly be.&nbsp; We cannot praise him too highly - we have travelled   extensively in Europe and the Middle East on Trafalger Tours and have not come   across a better tour guide than Kobus.              </p>
              <p>Coming back by train was most   enjoyable despite arriving 4,5 hours late.&nbsp; There too, the staff on the train   went out of their way to see to it that we had something to eat and drink at   lunchtime even though they were not due to serve us anything after   breakfast.              </p>
              <p>Would we go on another JB   Tour?&nbsp; Would we use the Premier Classe train for our next trip to Cape Town and   take our car down with us?&nbsp; The answer to both questions is &quot;Yes &hellip;.              </p>
              <p>We wish all the best for the   future and thanks for the memories.              </p>
              <p>Kind regards              </p>

              <p>Hi Jolene              </p>
              <p>I wish to thank you&nbsp;&amp; J B Tours for a wonderful   experience.<br />
                In spite of not being on the train to Cape Town the extra day   in Cape Town was very welcome.<br />
                The experience served to illustrate the importance of using a   well known tour company with the experience&nbsp;&amp; resources to make last minute   changes &amp; accommodate the group so capably.<br />
                It was a bonus to return on the Premier Class, especially as   the group had bonded and were friends. </p>
<p>Although the flowers were disappointing the trip was   wonderful. I have never been to that part of S A before and enjoyed every   minute.              </p>
              <p>Thank you for appointing Kobus as our guide. I doubt that   there is another guide as knowledgeable, patient and so darn   nice.              </p>
              <p>I will certainly look forward to&nbsp;booking another J B tour as   soon as possible.              </p>
              <p>Thank for your regular updates and professional   manner.              </p>

			  <p>Hi   Joleen </p>
<p>I must say   that despite not seeing many flowers, I did enjoy the trip and appreciate all   the efforts made in ensuring our trip proceeded, despite the cancellation of our   Premier Classe train on the downward journey. I can just imagine the logistical   nightmare it must have been trying to re-schedule all the trips that were   affected. It is at times like this, that a good tour company shows its mettle   and your company certainly came through with flying colours. I must also mention   that our tour guide, Kobus, was excellent and very informative and the driver of   our bus was first class. At no time did I feel nervous, even going up steep   passes, and I am usually uncomfortable in these situations.</p>
              <p>I certainly   will have no hesitation in recommending your company to friends and look forward   to doing further trips in the future. In fact, I am quite keen on the trip to   Namibia..              </p>
              <p>With kind   regards,</p>

              <p>&hellip;just   very briefly &ndash; our tour to Namaqualand was SIMPLY THE BEST. Man we had fun. We   ate far too much &ndash; and laughed even more. Kobus was the best guide ever and   Lloyd our coach driver was amazing.              </p>
              <p>Will   send you pics soon enough but please just know, from train journey to tour &ndash;   everything was so professionally run. Food was good. Accommodation for the most   was perfect.              </p>

I wish to thank you and the total team for making it possible,   under extremely difficult circumstances out of your control, for them to go and   have an experience they cannot stop talking about.              </p>
              <p>Although   the flowers were not a lot they said they learned a lot as well as laugh a lot   and the laughter part is which I wished for them.              </p>
              <p>Again   thanks for everything!</p>

              <p>Hi   Jolene,</p>
              <p>I would just like to   say that Kobus offered us great support and was very friendly.&nbsp; He really went   the extra mile in making us feel welcome on the train trip to Durban over this   weekend.</p>

			  <p>Beste Johan, Jolene en   ander</p>

                <p>'n Onvergeetlike toer   ondervinding, in geselskap van pragrtige mense, uitstekend ge-organiseer! Om   sulke natuurskoon op 'n motorfiets te mog ervaar, is 'n sonderlinge belewenis   wat moeilik verbaal oordraagbaar is. Het nie besef dat soveel asemrowende   taferele in die kort bestek van vier dae besigtig kan word nie.</p>

                <p>Sal baie graag weer so iets wil   aanpak. Dalk met een van my seuns.</p>
                <p>Baie dankie!!!</p>

			  <p>Hi   Jolene</p>
			  <p>This is a   short note to thank&nbsp; JB Tours for&nbsp;a fantastic&nbsp;time in the Cape last week. It was   my first bike by train tour , it was a wonderful experience and one I will do   again. Everything was handled most professionally, from the booking stage to   loading the bikes right through to the&nbsp;daily bike rides. Obviously we got to   know Mauritius and Piet Besem the best, they were excellent hosts and I felt   safe in their hands at all times. Also special thanks must go to all including   Johan, Jolene those on the station and those behind the   scenes.</p>
			  <p>Once again   , many thanks to everyone involved</p>
			  <p>Best   Regards</p>

                <p>Hi   Jolene,</p>

                <p>Thanks to &nbsp;good   organizing,special people such as yourself, Mauritius and Piet we had the best   time ever. &nbsp;As a &nbsp;small group we were all easy to get along with and each couple   or single rider I would like to believe has learned so much more about his/   there bike and themselves. &nbsp;The daily trips and different experiences such as   the home made meals and friendly locals from all over made you think that there   is still so much to see of our country.</p>

                <p>We enjoyed our bike and   the passes the roads were outstanding. &nbsp;Even though we had heavy wind from time   to time, we can say we experienced so many different daily site seeing and   looking forward to something &nbsp;small grouped and exciting   again.</p>

                <p>The train going down was   good no complains but somehow coming back in a new/refurbished train with   William and staff, somehow just smiled bigger and as for cleaning and great   food, we could not find fault.</p>

                <p>As for all the people   that we shared this week with, we are all a great bunch of real locals and   learned to respect a SCOOTER and Bert and we all had a fab   time.</p>

                <p>Mauritius and Piet YOU   were both what started and ended our special week &nbsp;with fond   memories.</p>

                <p>Safe riding and speak   again.<br />

                  <p>Hallo Jolene'<br />
                      <br />
                    Ja, ons het   die KKNK baie geniet en lekker moeg van al die stap, teruggekeer. Die Premier   Trein was vir my weereens baie aangenaam<br />
                    om mee te reis. My vriendin Amanda,   het dit ook netsoveel geniet. Dit was haar eerste keer met die trein. Ons albei   stem saam dat die <br />
                    Protea Riempies Hotel ook baie aangenaam was om in oor te   bly die Saterdagnag.<br />
                    <br />
                    Baie dankie vir   jul goeie diens wat ons verder geniet het.<br />
                    <br />

                  <p>The trip was absolutely   wonderful and very romantic. My husband and I are more in love than ever after   this trip. I was very impressed with the service on the train, the staff are so   friendly and very efficient. Been on the train was like been in a five star   Hotel, just a moving Hotel. I felt like royalty.&nbsp;Blue Waters Hotel is so   perfectly situated we could so much without having to go very far from the   Hotel. The view was fantastic and so serial. I came back from this trip feeling   so relaxed and revitalized. All I can say is that this is not my last trip.&nbsp;We   are truly grateful to you Jolene and JB Tours for this opportunity.</p>
                  <p>You guys have really set a   tread for us&nbsp;for 2010, that things can only get better and that this year is a   year to do more and see more of our beautiful country.&nbsp;Thank you again:-)</p>
